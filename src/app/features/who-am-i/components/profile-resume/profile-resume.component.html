  I'm a <span class="--text-highlight">Mechatronics Engineer</span> with a passion for integrating technology and user
  experience. ðŸš€
  <br> 
  <br> 
  My journey began with
  honing solid programming skills using <span  class="--text-highlight">embedded systems</span> and implementing <span  class="--text-highlight">Control & AI algorithms</span>. Due to the importance
  of UI in the projects I undertook, I specialized in different <span class="--text-highlight"> programming languages </span> and <span class="--text-highlight">frameworks</span>  for UI
  development.
  <br><br>
  Nowadays, I have participated in various projects, primarily focusing on <span class="--text-highlight">Full Stack WEB</span> applications where I have
  taken a <span  class="--text-highlight">leadership role</span> in <span class="--text-highlight">Frontend development</span>.
  <br><br>
  Currently, I am enthusiastic about merging <span class="--text-highlight">AI</span> and <span class="--text-highlight">WEB</span> development, taking into account performance and best practices,
  with the ultimate goal of revolutionizing and enhancing the way
  <span class="--text-highlight">users interact</span> with <span class="--text-highlight">technology</span>. ðŸ©·
